## Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning


### Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic data. The dataset used for this analysis contains multiple health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and more. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following key features:
Pregnancies â€“ Number of times pregnant
Glucose â€“ Blood glucose level
Blood Pressure â€“ Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness â€“ Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin â€“ 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI â€“ Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function â€“ Likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age â€“ Age of the individual
Outcome â€“ Binary variable (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

###Project Workflow

The project follows these steps:

Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values (if any)
Feature scaling and normalization
Train-test split

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing distributions of glucose, BMI, and other health indicators
Correlation heatmaps to identify feature importance

Model Selection & Training:
Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Compared model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Model Evaluation:
Used Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve
Identified the best-performing model for diabetes prediction

Predictions & Results:
Evaluated model predictions on test data
Provided insights on the most significant factors contributing to diabetes risk
